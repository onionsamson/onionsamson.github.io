<p><em>—Robocop [1987, Film] &amp; Starship Troopers [1997, Film] (both directed by Paul Verhoeven), and now Eve: Dust 514 [2011-2013 PS3 game], (in reference to interactive news feeds and tutorial videos respectively)</em></p>
<p>Whenever this memorable quote pops up I am simultaneously perplexed by it’s awkward phrasing and intrigued by the broadness of the question out-of-context.</p>
<p>Entering the world <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130207213846/https://dust514.com/">EVE: Dust 514</a> for the first time tonight, I was pleasantly surprised by this nod to two of my favourite sci-fi films.</p>
