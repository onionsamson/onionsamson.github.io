12 days is a long time in the world of Dropbox blogging.[^1] The attention
being given Dropbox publishing engines by the likes of the brilliant
[5by5](http://5by5.tv) podcasts; is like pouring water and warmth onto a
thirsty young plant. [Scriptogr.am](http://scriptogr.am) especially is adding
features and refining quality in quantum leaps.[^2]

All of my recent writing online has been about writing online. Since being
alerted to the existence of [Calepin](http://calepin.co "a Dropbox publishing
engine") (via [Koralatov](http://koralatov.com)) last November, promise was
shown that my wish for [the ideal static-site
generator](http://scriptogr.am/ibsimpson/post/regarding-calepin-its-new-competitors)
would be fulfilled.

Now I've finally stopped looking and am ready to settle down. Yes, I've been
made aware of more engines. To name a few (in the reverse-chronological order
that I learned of them): [DropType](http://droptype.com),
[Skrivr](http://skrivr.com), [Second Crack](http://www.marco.org/secondcrack),
[Octopress](http://octopress.org).

But, I am confident that *Scriptogr.am* has what I'm looking for, in droves.
My next post will be about something other than Dropbox publishing.


[^1]: Blogging is [apparently] dead. Long live publishing. I must admit
      to preferring the term _publishing_ over _blogging_. (I can see
      how the availability heuristic when applied to each term will always
      prefer publishing; which implies integrity, editing, serious,
      thought-out, etc. rather than, say for example, "LOL! Look at my
      catpuss".

[^2]: I am writing this using Scriptogr.am's online text editor. It's
      [everything iA Writer should've
      been](http://blog.fawny.org/2011/12/11/iawriter-unusability/), and
      more.
