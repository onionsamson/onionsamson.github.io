<p><strong>Iain</strong>: All else being equal, I wonder what it would have been like if I had been born ten years earlier.</p>

<p><strong>Mike</strong>: You'd be better off, and have a bigger and/or cheaper house (maybe both). Your primary leisure interest would probably still be gaming, but you'd have started on an earlier platform. Your overall lifespan would be marginally shorter, statistically speaking. You'd probably still fap to Thom Yorke's warblings.</p>
