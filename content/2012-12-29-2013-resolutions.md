<p>It’s getting to that time of year where many of us will be in a post-Christmas, post-gluttonous, dazed shellshock. Where we turn our greedy eye from the pickings of Christmas’ carcass for a brief, weary stare into the near-future. For this post I give a tip of the Santa hat to <a href="http://koralatov.com">Koralatov</a> who led me to the <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4966522">Hacker News post on 2013 Learning</a> that inspired me to write this.</p>

<p>These resolutions I am about to make; how can I stop myself forsaking them? How can they be achieved? Let’s move forward with the mindset that these resolutions are all centred around learning and developing new skills.</p>

<h2 id="formingaresolution">Forming a resolution</h2>

<p>When setting any learning objectives I would recommend putting them to the test:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why do you want to learn it? How will it benefit you, and what will you use your new skill for, e.g., to write a book, communicate with foreign friends, or type super-fast without having to backspace every few words to correct a spelling mistake.</li>
<li>How long will it take to learn?</li>
<li>When will you make the time to learn it? </li>
<li>These (one, two, and three) can be consolidated into the following question: Are your learning objectives all SMART, i.e., specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound [or variations thereof]?</li>
</ol>

<p>If your early learning objectives can’t be made to at least survive the above probing, I would suggest they be reworked or binned. The fact that every resolution you publicly announce will remain a fairly permanent testament to your future integrity invites a haunting guilt (or potentially valuable lesson) if you fail; and a prideful joy if you succeed.</p>

<h2 id="my2013resolutions">My 2013 Resolutions</h2>

<p>As an example, my 2013 personal resolutions are published below, and I invite you to do the same in the comments of this post, bookmark it and visit any time to share your progress/completion. I will be posting my updates and linking back to this post.</p>

<ol>
<li>For fun and to improve my computing skills: Learn how to use my <a href="http://raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a> effectively (learn linux), and put it to use at least once a month.</li>
<li>To communicate with my in-laws better: Learn enough Farsi (Modern Persian) to have a conversation and understand the meaning of overheard conversation. </li>
<li>To become a more effective typist: Learn to touch-type (for real) at least 70wpm with &gt;95% accuracy  by July 2013. </li>
<li>Become a better cook: Write down, practice and commit to memory at least 20 recipes that can make-up a staple repetoir.</li>
<li>To ultimately design and knit my own jumper: Learn the basics of knitting and knit at least five different items by June. </li>
<li>To ultimately make my own stoneware: Learn and practice ceramics. Buy all equipment by June to begin after knitting and finishing Project Management degree.</li>
</ol>
