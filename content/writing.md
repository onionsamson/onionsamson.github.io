You know that voice in your head that criticises every judgement and
decision that you are about to make? What path do you automatically
pilot this voice down? Do you first drive every hypothetical situation
to its worst conclusion, i.e., loss, failure, humility and/or death?

Some of us do, some of us don't. Forget that is important for now.

Often, trying to appraise and justify things only in our minds leads to
burying, evasion and fear. This leads to failure to act, which leads to
nothing.

That's where writing helps. Whether you prefer pencil and paper or word
processing software, getting it out of your mind and into reality (or
onto a computer screen), for me, makes it real, giving it weight and
importance.

Our minds' short-sighted (but intense) focus by itself is inhibited, and
tends towards entropy. Using this technique extends the breadth and
depth of our thinking.

Exploration by written conversation with yourself might also result in
some interesting conclusions. Discussing and pursuing a train of thought
to its end point, then scannning for another thread and drilling down to
the end of that. Alternative options hitherto undiscovered, are
revealed, considered and selected (or decryed).

Repeating to exhaustion, the outcome will be a rich set of information,
and hopefully an answer, if not a step in the right direction.

While gut instinct often provides *the* answer; explaining the
justification to yourself by writing is very, very reassuring.

It is powerful stuff, to write and create and make things real. Because
in your head, all ever anything will be is imaginary and temporary;
unrealised potential.

That is what makes me write.
