<p>Whatever possessed this architect to be so playful? They should be applauded for this incredible homage to what I see as a <em>Star Wars</em> character, but could just as ably be a <em>Space Invaders</em> reject.  I wonder when this building was designed and constructed, and if inside it there are other striking features and details.</p>

<p>Aside: Lochore Meadows Country Park is situated at Loch Ore. I am unclear on why it is contactenated, being that Lochore is not the same as Loch Ore, however I have respected the convention in this photographâ€™s title (and not at all for SEO optimisation).</p>
