<p>I used Juxtaposer (iOS) to layer a self-portrait with artificial light over a background photo I took during a recent visit to Broadsea (a part of Fraserburgh where my maternal grandfather grew up).</p>
<p>The different clothes textures and patterns combine with colour manipulation and the seaâ€™s horizon bisecting my face to add visual interest and complexity to two otherwise relatively bland photos.</p>
