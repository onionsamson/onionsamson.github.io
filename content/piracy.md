This isn't *Stand By Me*, and I don't want to split-up a fight by dying
of a wound from a stray knife. But I do want to talk about piracy and
lean on a couple of pieces published by Matt Gemmell and Harry Marks.

Matt Gemmell wrote about [how it's better to develop for iOS because
piracy isn't an issue, as it is for
Android](http://mattgemmell.com/2012/07/23/closed-for-business/ "Closed For Business").
Harry Marks
[agreed](http://curiousrat.com/home/2012/7/24/double-standards.html "Double Standards"),
but picked up on [a previous piece by Matt Gemmell advocating music and
movie
piracy](http://mattgemmell.com/2012/02/17/the-piracy-threshold/ "The Piracy Threshold").

After you filter through the emotional charge, cancel out any
conflicting hypocritical statements, you can pare away the arguments
presented in
[both](http://mattgemmell.com/2012/07/23/closed-for-business/ "Closed For Business")
[pieces](http://mattgemmell.com/2012/02/17/the-piracy-threshold/ "The Piracy Threshold")
by Gemmell. They make an interesting and thought-provoking read.

Marks concluded from Gemmel's posts:

That's not what I gathered from Gemmel at all. But his aggressive
writing doesn't win him any favours and can easily lead to being
misinterpreted. Write angry; read angry. Are all producers equal, or are
some (software developers) more equal than others?

The key message, Gemmell did make:

> We'll buy stuff if it's convenient to do so, and if the price is
> reasonable. Any sensible business would thus have as its goal "make
> our stuff convenient to buy, and price it reasonably".

Piracy might be driven by horrible Digital Rights Management (DRM) for
purchased (not rented) content; perceived high pricing; inconvenience of
purchase & delivery process; and exclusive access, e.g., *Game of
Thrones* cannot be bought by everyone. I assume ---and please correct me
if I am wrong--- that you must live in America and have a TV
subscription that includes HBO to access *Game of Thrones*.

I live in the UK and subscribe to Spotify, Netflix, and LoveFilm. These
services let me listen to and view an unlimited amount (from limited
catalogues) of music, TV series, and films. Good enough, cheap enough,
and with plenty enough choice for me. Renting rather than owning.
Existing in *the cloud*, where DRM is not a concern.

I wonder how much piracy has been mitigated by these services? I wonder
how fair a deal content creators are getting, and if new business models
are able to support great new music, TV, films and books.

I'll save discussion of Abandonware (primarily old games that are no
longer for sale and no longer supported by their original creators and
copyright holders) for a future post.

Ultimately the way to mitigate piracy is:

-   make it reasonably priced
-   make it easy to buy and download
-   allow anyone to buy it (never turn down people who want to give you
    their money)

And bonus points for purchased content (not rented content):

-   allow people to download and keep it offline
-   no DRM
