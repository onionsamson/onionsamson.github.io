<p>Human skills, as in skills relating to dealing with self and others, or as David Fraser puts it, <em>Relationship Mastery</em>, (named after his <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B005Y05X9E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B005Y05X9E&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ibsimpson-21">book</a> on the subject), are a nebulous, tacit grouping of hard to define, hard to explain knowledge. Or are they?</p>
<p>I recently co-presented a PMI event regarding project management in schools. David Fraser was the keynote speaker, and below are the notes I took during his talk.</p>
<p>Being very interested in how to understand and develop myself and others, his talk struck a chord with me; and so I am currently reading his book to investigate further.</p>
