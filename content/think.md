"What I think" versus "[W]hat I've learned". Arguably, they are
equally important. In my experience, I've derived more value from doing
and learning (after planning of course), than thinking alone.

Two things:

If you spend all your time thinking, and none of it doing, you're either
thinking inappropriately, or fear has overcome you. This is stopping
yourself from doing worthwhile things. You don't have much time.
Evaluate what feels right and get on with it.

While you're doing, it's worthwhile keeping a note of how you overcame
any obstacles and sorted out issues. Then, when you've done your thing,
you can share with others: "Here's what I've learned..."

How much greater to share what you've learned, than simply what you
think?
