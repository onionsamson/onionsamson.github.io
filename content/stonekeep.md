An RPG well ahead of it's time, and with a hilarious intro that Brian
Fargo surely had a good hand in; this is a game that growing up I always
wanted to play.

It slipped by me in the nineties and the aughties, but after recently
purchasing [Total
Annihallation](http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/total_anihilation_commander_pack)
from [Good Old Games](http://gog.com) and subsequently having trouble
installing on Windows XP via [VirtualBox for Mac OS
X](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), I thought I would browse
the rest of their catalogue.

Lo and behold, I found
[Stonekeep](http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/stonekeep) amongst many other
treasures that I will be revisiting soon: winter is coming. A little bit
of jiggery pokery with the wonderful [DOSBox](http://www.dosbox.com)
encased within the gorgeous Mac front-end GUI application, [Boxer
(app)](http://boxerapp.com) by Alun Bestor; and I was up and running.
