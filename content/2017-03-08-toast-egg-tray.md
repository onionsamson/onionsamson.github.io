<p>In addition to layer&#039;s pellets, leftover food often makes its way to our chickens, which have been wintering in the polytunnel. As I get through a lot of eggs, the output from the four hens we currently have is regularly supplemented by a tray or two of thirty eggs from a very local free-range farm via an even more local farm-shop.</p>
<p>This morning, I absent-mindedly laid <del>an egg</del> the extra piece of toast my daughter didn&#039;t eat (thanks to my overestimating her hunger) onto an empty egg tray by the door.</p>
<p>With the light streaming in from outside, the gradients shadowy depths to each trough is in stark contrast to the flat light toast. Something about the texture of both surfaces and the difference in colour made me arrange the toast square to the tray and photograph the composition.</p>
