<p>Since when did we benefit from wrapping our lives in anchors and chains? The effort required to start something new, really, is minuscule.</p>

<p>The determination and perserverance required to see it through to a hard-won success or failure is so much greater than the effort it takes to start something.</p>

<p>Is it the worrying about being able to commit that stops you from starting? Your perceived lack of competency, time or distractions? Excuses for others; guilt for yourself: a death spiral.</p>

<p>A recipe for success? Do it. Fail or succeed, learn, and move on.</p>

  <p>“Daddy, what does regret mean?<br />Well son, the funny thing about regret is, it’s better to regret something you have done, than to regret something you haven&#8217;t done.” — Famous Band, name ending in Surfers</p>
