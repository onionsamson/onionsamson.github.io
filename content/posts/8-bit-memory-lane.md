I had a Commodore 64 from around 5 years old. Before that we had a C16,
but I hardly remember it. I believe the C16 was a cast-off from my
father's work. Around the same time as the C64 we had a 286, which I
can't remember much about, other than a CGA *Breakout* clone.

The C64 was miles ahead of the Spectrum. Burned in my memory is the
silky smooth synth sounds, and gorgeous, colourful sprites. It put my
*Master System* to shame (in all except loading times). In fact, I would
often play the *Master System* while I waited for *Dizzy* or *Pitstop
II *or *Silkworm* to load.

I still have that C64, and it still works. Occasionally I will take it
down from the loft, fire it up and play some old classics. I have so
many cassettes with games that I cannot remember, or was unable to
comprehend as a child. So I try these out too; see what the designer was
reaching for; how they managed to overcome the constraints of 8-bit; but
also how they embraced it and made the most of it. High concepts
translated into simple games, often wonderfully executed and still
highly playable today. *IK+*, here I come again.

Which was your favourite computer/game, growing up?
