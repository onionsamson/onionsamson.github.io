<p>I have tens of gigabytes of RAW files, where JPEGs would do. In fact, if I make the time some day, I’ll do some spring cleaning, delete all the crappy photos, then batch convert <em>most</em> of the remainder to JPEG. (I’ll make some back-ups first of course.)</p>

<p>Because even after running <abbr title="jpegoptim is a utility for optimizing JPEG files. It provides lossless optimization (based on optimizing the Huffman tables) and “lossy” optimization based on setting a maximum quality factor.">jpegoptim</abbr>—see <a href="http://koralatov.com/post/47974583229/lossless-iphoto-compression" title="Koralatov – Lossless iPhoto Compression">here</a> for an excellent how-to by my friend Koralatov— and losslessly reclaiming ~1Gb from the scarce free float of my 250Gb SSD, I want more space, and to keep the whole library on my laptop. </p>

<p>Yes, I keep backups too, but that subject deserves a post all of it’s own.</p>
