I didn't publish the tweet above because it deserves discussion. As is
so often the case, Twitter is not the place for serious discourse.

As of 5th January 2012, [Calepin](http://calepin.co) (a recently
developed service from Jökull Sólberg for generating a static site from
markdown files in your Dropbox) is no longer alone.
[Scriptogram](http://Scriptogr.am) has joined the fray. Both Calepin and
Scriptogram are being rapidly developed. The current differentiator is
Calepin's stance on not having custom themes, its willingness to explore
paid options, and its greater level of polish. More on that soon.

Both services promise to have custom domains and other exciting features
coming soon. What do you want from your publishing platform?

The functionality I'm looking for:

-   easy to publish markdown text files into a static site
-   pages as well as posts
-   online and offline editing of text files (paid)
-   custom domains (paid)
-   custom themes (paid)
-   CSS inject (paid)

Scriptogr.am's homepage currently states all the features above will be
free with their service. Why? I'd prefer to pay for it.

This is only the beginning of a new plethora of services coming to
market. The marriage of geek with design in recent years (thanks to the
world-wide web) is producing new and interesting children (or
iteratively better Ripley clones as in *Alien: Resurrection* if you
like).

New services are coming thick and fast. Hat-tip to
[Koralatov](http://koralatov.com) for pointing out yet another emerging
service: [Skrivr](http://Skrivr.com)

In conclusion, I want simplicity in how I get my writing onto the web,
and control of that content. All these new services have the potential
to fulfil that. Some will rise to prominence, and I will be loyal to
those that fit best.
