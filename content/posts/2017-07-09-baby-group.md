<p>I designed and drew this logo for my wife to present to a new local mother and baby social group. My good friend <a href="http://koralatov.com">Korlatov</a> gave me some helpful critique on earlier iterations and I&#039;m pleased with the end result. </p>
<p>My original vision was to evoke a <a href="http://www.henri-matisse.net/biography.html">Henri Matisse</a> style and include a group of mums in a social situation: breastfeeding, pregnant, playing with children on their knee, drinking tea/coffee, and eating biscuits.</p>
<p>I wanted something that would scale well to different use cases, have elegant lines, and look good as line-art and filled with colour.</p>
<p>Once the group has a name, I&#039;ll revisit to adorn the logo with some hand-lettering, then allow the group to use it freely (on the condition that it is never used alongside Comic Sans).</p>
