<p>While browsing through Lightroom, I found this among my 2009 photos. I found these spiderlings outside our flat in Aberdeen one day, and I've never seen anything quite like it before or since. I got as close as I could with my best camera at the time, a Canon PowerShot G10, and this is the result.</p>
<p>I feel that the rough wall and depth of field focus works well with the soft bokeh of green vegetation and potato tub in the background. The palette of green, orange and brown, and surreal suspension of the tiny spiderlings is intriguing and repelling at the same time.</p>
