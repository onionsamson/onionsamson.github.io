<p>Booted up the <em>Playstation</em> to have a quick game of <em>Battlefield 3</em>. However, <em>Sony</em> demands I download a ~180Mb update (version 4.00). In countryside broadband terms, that's an hour gone. </p>

<p>What is the frequency of Sony PS3 updates? Because it seems every time I turn it on (infrequently since I bought an <em>XBOX 360</em> when <em>HALO: Reach</em> was released ☟), I have to download another system update.</p>

<p>Whereas, the <em>XBOX 360</em> updates are occasional and very small in comparison. I've never had to wait more than ten minutes.</p>

<p>So, <em>Battlefield 3</em>, I'm afraid you'll have to wait. I'm going back to <em>Battlefield: Bad Company 2</em> on the <em>XBOX 360</em>. And don't even get me started on the huge launch-day patch for <em>Battlefield 3</em>. </p>

<p>Perhaps I'l just buy a <a href="http://dingoo-scene.blogspot.com/2011/10/dingoo-a380-review.html" title="Dingoo A380 review">Dingoo A380</a> instead.</p>

<p>☞ Halo: Reach was a very disappointing game, I thought. <em>Killzone 2</em> does it so much better and came out far earlier [than <em>HALO: Reach</em>] (Feb 2009 versus September 2010).</p>
