<p>I delight in watching the whole process. </p>

<p>It begins with weird and wonderful egos and the initial inability to work in a team. Disgusting caterpillars.</p>

<p>Slowly, for the more diligent competitors, repulsive behaviour and ego is moulded into decency and teamwork. </p>

<p>As the process continues, you begin to learn about the individuals, and want the good ones to prevail. </p>

<p>Finally, a winner emerges and they have over the course of 3 months (our watching time, not sure if it's filmed over 3 months) emerged into a beautiful butterfly, their life forever transformed. </p>
