<p class="p1"><span style="line-height:1.6em;">If this makes you angry, you are probably a loser. Never fear. If you want it, change is only a harrowing, painful journey of reflection, self-awareness and action away. Of course, a tender loser and a smug winner are equally repugnant.</span><br></p><p class="p2">From the student-facing side of a training course name <em>toblerone</em> at Aberdeen Drilling School, July 2013:</p><blockquote>The winner is always part of the answer<br>
The loser is always part of the problem</blockquote><blockquote>The winner always has a program<br>
The loser always has an excuse</blockquote><blockquote>The winner says ‘let me do it for you’<br>
The loser says ‘that’s not my job’</blockquote><blockquote>When a winner makes a mistake, he says, ‘I was wrong’<br>
When a loser makes a mistake, he says, ‘it wasn’t my fault’</blockquote><blockquote>A winner says ‘I’m good, but not as good as I could be’<br>
A loser says ‘I’m not as bad as a lot of other people’</blockquote><blockquote>A winner feels responsible for more than his job<br>
A loser says, ‘I only work here’</blockquote><blockquote>The winner sees an answer in every problem<br>
The loser sees a problem in every answer</blockquote><blockquote>The winner says ‘it may be difficult but it’s possible’<br>
The loser says ‘it may be possible, but it’s too difficult’</blockquote><blockquote>A winner listens<br><span style="line-height:1.6em;">A loser waits for his turn to talk</span></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
