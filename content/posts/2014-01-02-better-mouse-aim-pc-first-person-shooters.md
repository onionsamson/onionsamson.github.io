<p>Improve your aim with <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/4920/">Natural Selection II</a> (NS2), currently £1.89 via Steam until 6 P.M. on 03-JAN-2014 (normally £18.99).</p>

<p>As I discovered watching <a href="http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SH7PKuW7mvA">Noobs Guide to Better Aim in Battlefield 4!</a> by the luminary FRANKIEonPCin1080p, the weapons in <em>NS2</em> have no recoil and are 100% accurate.</p>

<p>This theoretically makes it an excellent game to use in conjunction with <a href="http://www.mouse-sensitivity.com/">this mouse sensitivity calculator website</a> to improve your aim universally, e.g., in Battlefield 4.</p>
