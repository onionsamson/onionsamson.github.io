Do you have a job? A partner? A family? Hobbies? What commitments are
gnawing at you, and what promises have you made? How much time do you
really have?

Does free time become an ever-elusive myth as we grow older
(year-by-year)? Or do we just become poorer at managing our time?

The aim of this exercise is to provide a way for anyone to fix
time.[^1] If you often feel like you are treading water, the
following exercise can be a great help.

So let's start. Do you keep a notepad and pen/pencil(s) with you at all
times? That's rule \#1 towards being awesome. Taking the load off your
brain by writing things down will give you control. Expand your
short-term memory. Write it down.

Scrawl out your weekly division of time (for a typical, routine week)
---lets's call it a time planner---. Each day has 24 blocks; within each
block a maximum of three meaningful tasks.

Fills up pretty quick, huh? Any space left? Now what happens when you
want to add something to the heap? Or when someone asks if you can do
something for them? By planning your day-to-day life, you'll know if you
do \[have the time\] or not.

If you hold yourself to it, and you are honest, your estimating skills
(for yourself at least) will get better the more you do this: 'No, *task
x*won't take one hour, it'll take two, three, or five. Hmm. I really
like this task and I know how complex it is because I've done it before.
Now, where am I going to have three hours with enough energy and nothing
risky either side? Ah, next Wednesday. It's in the book.'

Capture progress in your notepad as you go: Planned: 3 hours. Actual: 2
hours. Difference explain: 'I was in the zone.'

Or (as happens quite often): Planned: 1 hour. Actual: 3 hours.\
Difference explained: 'I seriously underestimated the task and my
motivation/energy was fighting me. I let
[resistance](http://warofart.com "Steven Pressfield – The War of Art")
sap at my performance.'

To make time for something, you often have to not do something else.
Your cup brimmeth over already and compromise is a ghastly word I refuse
to say. Real artists ship.

By continually replacing things you have mastered/finished/failed
at[^2] with things you want to do that will make your life
better, you are winning. Congratulations.

So how's your time planner looking? Good? Great. Let's call it a diary
now. Anything you want to change or add? Keeping current with your diary
will pay off heaps when others ask for your time: 'Yes, I can work on
that experiment tomorrow night and mail you the frenzied, super-smart
simians then.'

Once you've got the right things to do, then there's nothing left but to
do them. That's the power of [Think Vs.
Learned](http://ibsimpson.com/post/think-vs.-learned "IBSIMPSON – Think Versus Learned").
And at the core of it, you'll do well in life by picking the right
things to do with your time, then doing them.

[^1]: If you are already really good at this, I'd like to hear from you.
How do you do it?

[^2]: Failing is only bad if you don't take the time to learn why and how
you failed. Likewise, success is only good if you learn why and how you
succeeded. Important lessons. Character building.
