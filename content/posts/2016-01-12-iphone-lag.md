<p>Mulling over <a href="http://openideas.ideon.co/2011/instagram-is-far-from-instant" title="Instagram is far from Instant">Hans Petter Eikemo's thoughts on iPhone photo lag</a>. Echoing his sentiments; the problem occurs as I experience some fleeting event. I want to capture it. From my trouser pocket to taking the photo takes me about six seconds, three if <em>camera.app</em> was open and active before I locked my iPhone. I have missed the moment. No Henri Cartier-Bresson chance; <a href="http://www.henricartierbresson.org/hcb/home_en.htm" title="Foundation Henri Cartier-Bresson">the man has met the puddle</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://openideas.ideon.co" title="Ideon Open Ideas">Hans Petter Eikemo</a> of Ideon proposes [for a future iPhone]:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>When the camera app is inactive, a press on the new [camera] button will launch it.</li>
  <li>Every press captures a photo, even outside the camera app. As a remedy for the most fleeting of photo ops; you shoot instantly from the hip, and when the app is ready, you may review the results or continue to shoot assisted by the viewfinder.</li>
  <li>Press and hold the button momentarily to record video. The subsequent press stops recording.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I am against a new button, because we don't need one. The shutter release (sic - pixel sensor ready and capture) could be initiated in different ways depending on the situation. Let's go through some [iPhone] scenarios.</p>

<p>The phone is asleep in your pocket. You want to take a photo. Quick! Take if out of your pocket and either:</p>

<ol>
<li>double-click <em>volume-up</em> button (hold for video)</li>
<li>double-click <em>volume-down</em> button (hold for video)</li>
<li>depress <em>volume-up</em> and <em>volume-down</em> button simultaneously (hold for video)</li>
<li>depress-<em>volume-up</em> and <em>home</em> button simultaneously (hold for video)</li>
<li>depress <em>volume-down</em> and <em>home</em> button simultaneously (hold for video)</li>
</ol>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>A setting would allow you to enable the feature to capture photos and/or video from <em>sleep mode</em>. Thus, Private Percy's Privacy is Protected from Prankster Peter.</li>
<li>A setting would allow you to launch into <em>camera.app</em> (or not) after taking photos from <em>sleep mode</em>.</li>
<li>Initiating video capture from <em>sleep mode</em> would launch <em>camera.app</em> while you are shooting that video.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>
