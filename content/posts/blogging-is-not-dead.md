So if we have a blog, we should use it to share thoughtful writing?

Agreed.

We have come a long way from GeoCities, which is now defunct. But you
can, for nostalgic reasons, make any website eye-bleedingly horrific
using
[geocitiesizer](http://wonder-tonic.com/geocitiesizer/ "Geocitiesizer").

It would be interesting to compare blogging then (teenagers' GeoCities
site are not the best example), to blogging now.

As we naturalise the web, it seems the path to good design is more
accessible, and new technology makes it easily achievable, as evidenced
in Stephanie Marcus' article: [A Brief History of
Blogs](http://mashable.com/2010/08/06/history-of-blogs/ "Stephanie Marcus - A Brief History of Blogs")

While I comprehend that design is a medium for the message, style versus
substance [...] I am inspired by good design.

At the very least, good design lets *the message* speak. And at the very
best: it informs *the message* and adds value to it.
