<p>During a walk around the outskirts of my local town, I saw this bin while grasping for cherries from the trees in the lane.</p>
<p>I found the brittle slate-like coating lifting from the corroding metal cut-out letters and bleeding into the white border utterly beautiful. </p>
<p>The shape of the space delineated by the coating&#039;s edge looks like a map (topography), fish or boat (side-view).</p>
