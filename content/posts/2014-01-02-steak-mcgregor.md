<p>A good friend recently asked for this recipe. It has been about ten years since I made it for a small group of studying artists, having practised it a few times prior. The name, if not the invention, comes from my father. (Using a basic internet search, I found no other trace of the name used for this recipe.)</p>

<p>It is rich in personal meaning, but even more in its delicious repeatable flavour. I make it several times each year, The sweet potato wedges are a recent improvement, courtesy of my wife and her brilliantly creative culinary skills.</p>

<p>This marks the first time I have ever featured a recipe in this blog; though I did write a little about food in a previous incarnation. It has proven quite a pleasure to write this recipe down, so I may publish some more in future. </p>

<h2 id="sequence">Sequence</h2>

<p>Preheat oven 180 ℃ fan oven | 200 ℃ non-fan oven. <br />
Prepare side dish. <br />
Prepare wedges and put in oven. <br />
Cook steak and sauce. <br />
Serve.</p>

<h2 id="ingredientsandmethods">Ingredients and Methods</h2>

<h3 id="cheeseandcarrotmayoside">Cheese and Carrot Mayo Side</h3>

<p>1 Carrot, grated <br />
100g Mature Cheddar Cheese, grated <br />
3–4 tbsp (tablespoon) Mayonnaise
1 tsp (teaspoon) Wholegrain Mustard (optional) </p>

<p>Put ingredients in serving bowl and stir with fork.</p>

<h3 id="sweetpotatowedges">Sweet Potato Wedges</h3>

<p>1 Sweet Potato, peeled and cut into wedges
1½ tsp Paprika <br />
½ tsp Cumin <br />
½ tsp Turmeric <br />
½ tsp Garlic Powder <br />
1–2 tbsp Olive Oil</p>

<p>Put spices and oil in bowl. <br />
Throw in wedges and toss until evenly coated in spices and oil.</p>

<p>Place on metal baking tray, atop a silicon baking sheet, into a pre-heated 180 ℃ fan oven for twenty minutes or thereabouts, prodding at halfway.  </p>

<h3 id="panfriedsteakandmcgregorwhiskycreamsauce">Pan-fried Steak and McGregor Whisky Cream Sauce</h3>

<p>1 tbsp Butter <br />
1 tbsp Olive Oil <br />
1 Onion, sliced <br />
2 Steaks (whatever cut you like, fatty rib-eye steaks are my favourite) <br />
40ml Whisky (inexpensive supermarket blend) <br />
184ml Double Cream <br />
Pinches of Salt and Pepper</p>

<p>Hob at medium heat, pour oil and butter in 10-inch frying pan. Once butter melts, add onions, which will soften in 7–10 minutes, then remove all from pan onto a side plate.</p>

<p>Turn up heat to high for now-empty pan, however not so high/long that it smokes. Pat steaks dry with kitchen towel. Season each side with a little salt and pepper and rub in some olive oil. Drop steaks into hot pan, leave for two minutes then flip over. After one minute on this side, ready the whisky:</p>

<p>BE VERY BLOODY CAREFUL with this stage as the flames can be several feet tall for several seconds, scorching kitchen fixtures and hairy hands—Carefully glug out two to three fingers of whisky over the steaks, then ignite with cooking lighter. Whoosh.The flames will subside after a few seconds.</p>

<p>Turn the heat down to medium, reintroduce the onions to the pan and add all the cream. Stir around until the cream colour is replaced by a delicious caramel colour. Keep cooking, poking at occasionally until sauce thickens (4–10 minutes).</p>
