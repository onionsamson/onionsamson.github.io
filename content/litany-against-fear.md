The Bene Gesserit Litany Against Fear from
[Dune](http://dunenovels.com "The Official Dune Website"), by Frank
Herbert, via [Dawn Ardent](http://www.aeriagloris.com "Aeria Gloris"):

Fear is an internal force that acts against your best intentions. It
cannot be killed, but it can be fought, on a daily basis. Fear wields
arms such as procrastination, laziness and depression that will thrash
wildly to stop you from doing what you know to be necessary, or what you
truly love. Fear is out to get you; to dominate and suppress you; to
break your commitments and promises.

But fear comes from within. So why is it part of us? A scum that cannot
be skimmed or conquered. It is perhaps a necessary byproduct of our
perception, critical thinking and decision making functions. Fear may be
a basic and primal survival mechanism. Definitely, it has borne me
through some difficult times (via a state of unthinking autopilot).

Surviving and living are very different. The former requires submission
to fear and a miserable, hollow life. The latter requires a control of
fear, and ---I think--- a curiosity and thirst for new experiences and
challenges. Living is growing. Surviving is entropy and death.

When you feel the desperate, smothering blackness of fear all around
you, recall the Bene Gesserit Litany Against Fear. Think it, say it,
shout it, scream it out. Whatever it takes. Then do something about it.
